The code developers should use branches to work on code while there are multiple people making changes at the same time, or perhaps when there is an error in the main code so they are working on certain parts of the code to work around the errors. The branches should also have useful names that show which part of the code they are focused on. These branches can be merged when the group agrees that merging the code will help the project. "

    "Debugging is the process of finding errors in our code and removing them. When running the code, we might get an error message showing why the code is not running. This will help show us the line where the first error is that causes the code to not run. Sometimes, the code will run but will not return the correct or expected results. In these cases, it might be a good idea to use a debugger that will show you exactly what your code is doing line by line and will show you what values your variables are holding and how the incorrect result is being returned. Three of the main types of errors are syntax errors, logic errors, and runtime errors. A syntax error may be when something is missplelled or used before it is declared. To fix these, we can carefully go through the code and make sure everything is defined,spelled correctly, and is written with proper syntax. Logic errors are errors in how the code is working. An example would be using the incorrect logic operator. To fix these, we should go through the code carefully, perhaps using a debugger, and make sure that we understand why the code is not working correctly. Runtime errors occur when the code is executed. This can happen when we try to perform actions that are not possible, such as dividing by 0. To fix these, we should make sure all of our variables are defined, and that all objects being returned from loops or arrays do exist. "
